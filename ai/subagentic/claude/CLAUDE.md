# Global Claude Code Agents

This file provides guidance and memory for your coding CLI.

# MANDATORY: Orchestrator-First Routing Pattern

**System Instruction for Claude Code**:
When processing ANY user request, invoke the `orchestrator` agent FIRST unless:
- User explicitly mentions a specific agent: `@agent-id` or `As agent-id, ...`
- User invokes a skill: `/skill-name`
- User gives a direct command: `npm test`, `git status`, file operations, etc.

**Why orchestrator first?**
- Analyzes user intent and matches to optimal workflow
- Asks clarifying questions for conditional workflow steps (e.g., "Research first?")
- Coordinates multi-agent sequences with minimal context passing
- Ensures systematic approach to complex tasks

**Orchestrator reads this registry** to match requests to specialists and invoke via Task tool with selective context injection.

# Claude subagents and Tasks (Claude Code)

Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md when other subagents want to invoke other subagents, tasks, or resources

## How To Use With Claude

Activate agents by mentioning their ID in your prompts:
- `"@qa-test-architect review this code"`
- Copy/paste `claude` subfolders in this project to ~/.claude and Claude will read and access agents from ~/.claude/agents and tasks from ~/.claude/resources/tasks-brief.md,
- You can access agents using "@ux-expert", or you can reference a role naturally, e.g., "As ux-expert, implement ..." or use commands defined in your tasks.

Note
- Orchestrators/master run as mode: primary; other agents as mode: subagents.
- All agents have enbaled tools: write, edit, bash.

## Common Workflow Patterns

The orchestrator uses these patterns to match user intent to multi-agent workflows. Each step is **conditional** - orchestrator asks user approval before advancing.

### 1. Feature Discovery Flow (Most Common)
**User Intent**: "I need to add [feature]", "Build [new functionality]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator analyzes → asks: "Research competitive approaches first?"
  ├─ Yes → business-analyst (research) → ask: "Create formal PRD?"
  │   ├─ Yes → 1-create-prd → ask: "Generate implementation tasks?"
  │   │   ├─ Yes → 2-generate-tasks → ask: "Start systematic implementation?"
  │   │   │   ├─ Yes → 3-process-task-list
  │   │   │   └─ No → Done (user has task list for review)
  │   │   └─ No → Done (user has PRD for review)
  │   └─ No → Done (user has research for review)
  └─ No → 1-create-prd → (same conditional tree from PRD onward)
```

### 2. Product Definition Flow
**User Intent**: "We're considering a new product/initiative", "Strategic product planning"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → ask: "Follow product definition workflow?"
└─ Yes → product-manager (strategy, vision) → ask: "Define user stories?"
    └─ Yes → product-owner (backlog, stories) → ask: "Technical feasibility assessment?"
        └─ Yes → holistic-architect (platform decisions, technical design)
```

### 3. Story Implementation Flow
**User Intent**: "Implement [existing story]", "Build [defined feature with acceptance criteria]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → ask: "Validate story readiness first?"
├─ Yes → product-owner (validate acceptance criteria) → full-stack-dev → qa-test-architect
└─ No → full-stack-dev (implement) → qa-test-architect (quality gate)
```

### 4. Architecture Decision Flow
**User Intent**: "Should we use [tech A] or [tech B]?", "How should we architect [system]?"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → business-analyst (gather constraints, requirements)
            → holistic-architect (options analysis, tradeoffs)
            → ask: "Need product alignment?"
            └─ Yes → product-manager (strategic alignment, decision rationale)
```

### 5. UI Development Flow
**User Intent**: "Build [UI component]", "Design and implement [interface]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → ux-expert (wireframes, design system)
            → ask: "Complex enough to need PRD?"
            ├─ Yes → 1-create-prd → full-stack-dev → qa-test-architect
            └─ No → full-stack-dev (implement) → qa-test-architect (validate)
```

### 6. Bug Triage Flow
**User Intent**: "Bug: [description]", "Fix [broken behavior]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → full-stack-dev (investigate root cause)
            → ask: "Severity level?"
            ├─ Critical → full-stack-dev (immediate fix) → qa-test-architect (verify)
            └─ Non-critical → 1-create-prd (bug story) → backlog (for sprint planning)
```

### 7. Brownfield Discovery Flow
**User Intent**: "Help me understand this codebase", "Document existing system"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → context-initializer (build knowledge base, discover patterns)
            → business-analyst (document current state, stakeholders)
            → ask: "Assess technical debt and modernization opportunities?"
            └─ Yes → holistic-architect (technical assessment, recommendations)
```

### 8. Quality Validation Flow
**User Intent**: "Review this PR", "Check code quality before merge"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → qa-test-architect (comprehensive review)
            → [Decision gate]
            ├─ PASS → Done (ready to merge)
            ├─ CONCERNS → Present issues → user decides next step
            └─ FAIL → full-stack-dev (apply fixes) → qa-test-architect (re-validate)
```

### 9. Sprint Planning Flow
**User Intent**: "Plan next sprint", "Prepare sprint backlog"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → product-manager (prioritize features for sprint)
            → scrum-master (break into user stories)
            → product-owner (add acceptance criteria)
            → 2-generate-tasks (create sprint backlog with tasks)
```

### Selective Context Injection

When orchestrator invokes specialists, it passes **minimal necessary context**:

**✓ Include**:
- Direct user requirements for the specific task
- Outputs from immediate workflow dependencies only
- Relevant domain-specific files/data

**✗ Exclude**:
- Full conversation history
- Unrelated workflow step outputs
- Tangential project context

**Example**: When invoking `qa-test-architect`:
- ✓ Include: code diff, test requirements, acceptance criteria
- ✗ Exclude: PRD creation discussions, UI wireframes, database schema decisions
